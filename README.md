# UCL Mushroom Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on the classification and clustering of mushrooms using the UCL Mushroom Dataset. Our goal is to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous and identify patterns through clustering.

## Contents
- `classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for mushroom classification analysis.
- `clustering.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for mushroom clustering analysis.

## Setup
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries are listed in each notebook.

## Running the Notebooks
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook to view the analyses.

## Methodology
- **Classification**: Various machine learning models are tested to classify mushrooms.
- **Clustering**: Exploratory data analysis followed by clustering algorithms to identify patterns.
